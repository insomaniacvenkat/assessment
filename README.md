Assessment Test

Run 127.0.0.1 on your local server to visit the page

- What frameworks and libraries youâ€™ve used?
I Have used React.js for front end and laravel for backend

-  How your implementation works?
Firstly, User has to login to the website and then signin
Secondly, Form page opens and based on the user answers the tabs change in the option
Thirdly, The options selected by the user will be saved in the database

- What alternative could you use? How much difference would that make?
Apart from laravel we can use cakePHP so the overall user experience will be ease along with the coding challenges as it is easy to use for database.
